        <div id="body-text">The design of this visualization is largely inspired by what I saw during my critique assignment, when I analyzed what I thought worked and what I thought didn't.<br><br>
	To begin, a simple bar chart was chosen for this visualization because the comparison that is being made is relatively simple. The dataset provides a snapshot of
	data, without dates for the sake of comparisons over time. As such, a bar chart seemed a succinct way to represent the data set and the answers to the question being
	asked. Below is the initial mock-up for what I had envisioned at the start of this project. As you can see, the initial mock-up contains a lot of the elements that
	would eventually make it into the final visualization. From the beginning, I wanted a chart that displayed the answer to the initial question: if one gender
	spent more on average than the other and a secondary chart that provides a more detailed breakdown. I also wanted a tooltip to pop up when the bars were 
	hovered over. The data contained in the secondary chart is technically redundant with the data contained within the tooltip, but I believe that it was
	necessary to include both because I thought it was helpful to be able to see the exact numbers and to see, visually, how they compare with one another.
	The purchase amount columns were encoded via color by gender. For males, the column was encoded as blue and for females the column was encoded as pink.
	This was done for a simple reason: at a glance, you immediately know which column is which. While perhaps it is somewhat stereotypical, those are the colors that
	our culture tends to associate with each gender. Additionally, the decision was consciously made to set the maximum height of the bar chart 10 unites higher
	than the top of each bar. This decision was made because, to be blunt, it looked better. it does not skew the visualization and it is still easy to see how 
	close the averages are. A notable disinclusion from the mock-up to the final visualization is the presence of multiple buttons, which would activate whatever
	visualization one wished to see at a given time. With two charts, it is easy enough to just click the button again to get to the other one.</div>
