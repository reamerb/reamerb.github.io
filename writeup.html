            The findings for this visualization were not super surprising overall. We found that men and women spend approximately the same amount per purchase, on average.
	    That alone is not groundbreaking, but the further breakdown provides interesting context. Outerwear was the lowest of the top 4 categories for both sexes, and
	    clothing was the second category for both sexes. What surprised me is that men's top category was footwear and women's was accessories. For each gender, the other
	    gender's top category took their third place.
