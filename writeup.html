        <div id="body-text">The design of this visualization is largely inspired by what I saw during my critique assignment, when I analyzed what I thought worked and what I thought didn't.<br><br>
	To begin, a simple bar chart was chosen for this visualization because the comparison that is being made is relatively simple. The dataset provides a snapshot of
	data, without dates for the sake of comparisons over time. As such, a bar chart seemed a succinct way to represent the data set and the answers to the question being
	asked. Below is the initial mock-up for what I had envisioned at the start of this project. </div>
